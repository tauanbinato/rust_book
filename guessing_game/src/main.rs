// In this program we learned about:
// - Using external crates
// - Using the rand crate to generate random numbers
// - Using the std::cmp module to compare two values
// - Using the std::io module to take user input
// - Using the match expression to handle different possibilities
// - Using the Ordering enum to compare values
// - Using the Result type to handle errors
// - Using the expect method to handle the Result type
// - Using the parse method to convert a string into a number
// - Using the shadowing feature to convert a value from one type to another type
// - Using the trim method to eliminate whitespace
// - Using the loop keyword to create an infinite loop
// - Using the break keyword to exit a loop
// - Using the continue keyword to skip the rest of the loop and start a new iteration
